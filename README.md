## PROJECT TITLE: HR Data

### Project Overview 
---
This Data Analysis Project aims to generate insight into the employee behaviour of the employees of a company. Analysing the paramaters in the data, I sought to gather insight to enable me to tell a compelling story around the data from the insight gotten and to determine the best performance from the data.
